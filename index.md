## I'm currently working on some python projects:

### stravatracker

[stravatracker](https://github.com/rakeshrgill/stravatracker) is a project I wrote to track my workouts. It extracts workouts using the Strava api. It can also track key metrics and progress over time. The main purpose was to get myself familiar with writing a program on python. The project includes some basic menus, error handling, custom modules and the pandas library. During the development, I learned how to use git, the flake8linter, VSCode and virtual environments. I also practiced including docstrings in the numpy format. Pytest was used in the main file before it was given up in favour of completion.
